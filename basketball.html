    <p>basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team
        tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a
        basket.

        The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about
        December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield
        College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.</p>
    <p>For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the
        sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a
        midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and numerous
        associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15, 1892, issue of the
        Triangle, the YMCA Training School’s campus paper.</p>
    <p>While basketball is competitively a winter sport, it is played on a 12-month basis—on summer playgrounds, in
        municipal, industrial, and church halls, in school yards and family driveways, and in summer camps—often on an
        informal basis between two or more contestants. Many grammar schools, youth groups, municipal recreation
        centres, churches, and other organizations conduct basketball programs for youngsters of less than high school
        age. Jay Archer, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, introduced “biddy” basketball in 1950 for boys and girls under 12
        years of age, the court and equipment being adjusted for size.</p>
    <p>In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of
        the playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800
        square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600
        square feet (334.5 square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was
        occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number
        has remained ever since.</p>

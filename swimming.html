    <p>swimming, in recreation and sports, the propulsion of the body through water by combined arm and leg motions and
        the natural flotation of the body. Swimming as an exercise is popular as an all-around body developer and is
        particularly useful in therapy and as exercise for physically handicapped persons. It is also taught for
        lifesaving purposes. For activities that involve swimming, see also diving, lifesaving, surfing, synchronized
        swimming, underwater diving, and water polo.</p>

        Archaeological and other evidence shows swimming to have been practiced as early as 2500 BCE in Egypt and
        thereafter in Assyrian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. In Greece and Rome swimming was a part of martial
        training and was, with the alphabet, also part of elementary education for males. In the Orient swimming dates
        back at least to the 1st century BCE, there being some evidence of swimming races then in Japan. By the 17th
        century an imperial edict had made the teaching of swimming compulsory in the schools. Organized swimming events
        were held in the 19th century before Japan was opened to the Western world. Among the preliterate maritime
        peoples of the Pacific, swimming was evidently learned by children about the time they walked, or even before.
        Among the ancient Greeks there is note of occasional races, and a famous boxer swam as part of his training. The
        Romans built swimming pools, distinct from their baths. In the 1st century BCE the Roman Gaius Maecenas is said
        to have built the first heated swimming pool.

        Internationally, competitive swimming came into prominence with its inclusion in the modern Olympic Games from
        their inception in 1896. Olympic events were originally only for men, but women’s events were added in 1912.
        Before the formation of FINA, the Games included some unusual events. In 1900, for instance, when the Games’
        swimming events were held on the Seine River in France, a 200-metre obstacle race involved climbing over a pole
        and a line of boats and swimming under them. Such oddities disappeared after FINA took charge. Under FINA
        regulations, for both Olympic and other world competition, race lengths came increasingly to be measured in
        metres, and in 1969 world records for yard-measured races were abolished. The kinds of strokes allowed were
        reduced to freestyle (crawl), backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. All four strokes were used in individual
        medley races. Many nations have at one time or another dominated Olympic and world competition, including
        Hungary, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France, Great Britain, Canada, Japan, and the United States.

    <p>football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of
        their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the
        goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The
        team that scores more goals wins.

        Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its
        principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing
        fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the
        Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there
        were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a
        combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial
        month-long World Cup finals.</p>
    <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had
        been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and
        urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a
        history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine
        the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between
        residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its
        own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult
        for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843
        an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students
        joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge
        graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and
        surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus,
        the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all
        handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.</p>

    <p>Squash is a fast-moving racket sport. It can be played with two people in a singles match and four people in a
        doubles contest. The game is played within a four-walled court, with a small, hollow rubber ball. Both players
        are also equipped with squash rackets.</p>
    <p>The game of Squash is a great upper and lower body workout, strengthening muscles and burning up to 800 calories
        per hour - perfect for older people who are looking to stay healthy. Remember, the NHS advises that older people
        looking for a more intense workout routine should aim for 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, and strength
        exercises on two or more days a week that work the major muscles in their body.</p>

       <p> You're constantly moving your body during a game of squash, chasing a ball that can reach speeds of up to 170mph
        in some games. So, playing a game of squash can improve the following aspects of your health:</p>
    <ul style="color: white;">
        <li><p>Cardiovascular - You'll be running, leaping, and diving for that ball.</p></li>
        <li><p>Core strength.</p></li>
        <li><p>Flexibility and back strength.</p></li>
        <li><p>Weight.</p></li> 
    </ul>
        <p>Of course, you'll also be improving your hand-eye coordination and agility on the court. Your brain will
        constantly be working as you try to work out how and where to hit the ball, in order to gain an advantage over
        your opponent. Concentration is key during a game of squash. You've always got the be thinking ahead and looking
        to out-smart your rival - you cannot take your eye off the ball for a second.</p>

        <p> Playing a game of squash can also help to reduce any stress that may have built up during the day or week. Much
        like going to the gym, taking your anger out on the squash ball is a great way of releasing any stress.</p>

        <p>Away from the physical side of things, playing squash is also a great social activity. You need at least two
        people to play, which means you're either going to be taking a friend with you or making new ones at your local
        sports club.</p>

        <p>Having an active social life is important as you age, as you look to make sure that you don't become lonely.
        You're bound to make friends at a squash club, as you already have one thing in common with everybody there.</p>
